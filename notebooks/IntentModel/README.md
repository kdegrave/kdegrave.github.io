As part of my initial work at Mercury Healthcare, I was tasked with creating custom reporting automation to summarize and convey important web metrics to senior leadership at the company. The solution I formulated was carried out in Python using an open-source library called OpenPyXL. OpenPyXL allowed us to easily display and distribute our data in Excel format on a recurring weekly basis. As part of this reporting, metrics falling outside of their typical week-to-week range were flagged in red to draw the eye. The code base is listed in this directory, and an example reporting sheet is shown below.
