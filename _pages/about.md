My name is Kyle DeGrave, and I'm a data scientist at Mercury Healthcare. I received my PhD in astronomy from New Mexico State University in May of 2015. I love digging into messy data to help others make informed decisions! This website was created to document some of the things I've worked on during my time at Mercury Healthcare, along with some small side projects I've done for fun. I'll be adding to the list in the future, so be sure to check back soon.

Thanks for visiting!
